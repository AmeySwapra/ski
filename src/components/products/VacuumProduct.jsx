              A Vacuum Lifter is a tool designed to lift safely and efficiently, and move heavy loads. It utilizes vacuum to generate a strong suction force to securely hold the load in place. Vacuum lifters are versatile and efficient material handling devices used in various industries. They rely on suction technology to securely and gently lift and transport a wide range of materials, such as glass panels, metal sheets, and various products in manufacturing, logistics, and construction.

              Vacuum lifters also known as "suction lifter," "vacuum handling equipment," "vacuum gripper," and "vacuum lifting system." These devices enhance workplace safety, minimize manual labor, and improve productivity, making them essential tools in industries where precision, control, and the safe movement of heavy or fragile loads are paramount.
